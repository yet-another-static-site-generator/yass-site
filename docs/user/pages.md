## <a name="general"></a>General information
At this moment, all configuration for each page is inside files with page
content. They have syntax: `[CommentMark] [Key]: [Value]`. Default setting
for the `[CommendMark]` is `--` but you can change it in `site.cfg` file.

* Same as site settings, each pair must be in one line. Neither `Key` nor
  `Value` can't contain new line.
* Settings can be added in any place of file (at beginning, between text, at
  end, etc) just they must start with new line.
* All settings are case-sensitive.
